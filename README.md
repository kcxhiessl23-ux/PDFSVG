# PDF Label Cropper for Glowforge

Automated batch processing of solar installation PDFs to extract "CAUTION: MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POWER" labels as clean SVG files for laser engraving.

## Overview

This tool processes ~200 PDFs/month using Roboflow AI to automatically detect and crop label regions, then adds addresses from a Google Sheet lookup.

### What It Does

1. **Detects** label bounding boxes using Roboflow object detection
2. **Crops** the vector PDF (not rasterized) to the detected region
3. **Exports** as clean SVG for Glowforge scoring
4. **Adds** address text from Google Sheets based on job code

## Requirements

### Python Libraries

**Required:**
```bash
pip install pymupdf roboflow
```

**Optional (only if using Google Sheets instead of CSV):**
```bash
pip install gspread google-auth
```

### Accounts & APIs

- **Roboflow Account**: For object detection model (required)
- **Google Cloud Project**: Only needed if using Google Sheets (optional, see GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md)

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Settings

Edit `label_processor.py`:

```python
INPUT_FOLDER = r"C:\path\to\PDFs"
OUTPUT_FOLDER = r"C:\path\to\SVGs"
TEMP_FOLDER = r"C:\path\to\temp"

CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 40  # Detection confidence (30-50 recommended)
DPI_FOR_DETECTION = 96     # Image quality for detection

ENABLE_ADDRESS_LOOKUP = True  # Set False to skip address lookup
```

### 2. Test Roboflow Connection

```bash
python test_roboflow.py
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ Workspace loaded: placardcleanup
âœ“ Project loaded: placard_cleanup-imhpc
âœ“ Version loaded: 2
âœ“ Model object created
âœ“ SUCCESS: All checks passed!
```

### 3. Set Up Address Lookup (Choose One)

#### Option A: CSV File (Recommended - Simple & Free!)

See **CSV_SETUP.md** for detailed instructions.

Quick version:
1. Edit `job_codes.csv` with your job codes and addresses
2. Save it in the same folder as `label_processor.py`
3. Done! (Already configured by default)

#### Option B: Google Sheets (For Team Collaboration)

See **GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md** for detailed instructions.

**Note**: Google Sheets API is FREE for your use case (no credit card needed), but CSV is simpler!

To use Google Sheets:
1. Follow GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md
2. Change one line in `label_processor.py`:
   ```python
   ADDRESS_LOOKUP_METHOD = "GOOGLE_SHEETS"
   ```

### 4. Run the Processor

```bash
python label_processor.py
```

Example output:
```
============================================================

## Project Files

- **label_processor.py** - Main batch processing script
- **job_codes.csv** - Simple address lookup file (RECOMMENDED)
- **csv_address_lookup.py** - CSV lookup module with testing
- **address_lookup.py** - Google Sheets integration module (optional)
- **test_roboflow.py** - Roboflow connection diagnostic tool
- **CSV_SETUP.md** - Simple CSV setup guide (2 minutes)
- **GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md** - Google Sheets setup guide (optional, 10 minutes)

## Configuration Options

### Detection Settings

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 40
```
- **Lower (30)**: More detections, may include false positives
- **Higher (50)**: Only confident detections, may miss some labels

```python
DPI_FOR_DETECTION = 96
```
- **Lower (96)**: Faster processing
- **Higher (150)**: Better detection accuracy for small details

### Address Lookup

```python
ENABLE_ADDRESS_LOOKUP = True
```
- **True**: Look up addresses from CSV or Google Sheets
- **False**: Skip address lookup entirely (fastest)

```python
ADDRESS_LOOKUP_METHOD = "CSV"  # or "GOOGLE_SHEETS"
```
- **"CSV"**: Use simple CSV file (recommended, default)
- **"GOOGLE_SHEETS"**: Use Google Sheets (requires setup)

## Improving Detection Accuracy

### Immediate Fixes (No Retraining)

1. **Adjust confidence threshold**:
   ```python
   CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 35  # Try lower value
   ```

2. **Increase detection quality**:
   ```python
   DPI_FOR_DETECTION = 150  # Higher quality image
   ```

### Long-term Improvements (Requires Retraining)

1. **Add training data**:
   - Upload failed PDFs to Roboflow
   - Draw bounding boxes around labels
   - Retrain as Version 3

2. **Enable augmentations**:
   - In Roboflow project settings
   - Enable rotation, brightness, contrast variations

3. **Use larger model**:
   - Switch from YOLOv8n to YOLOv8m or YOLOv8l
   - Slower but more accurate

## Troubleshooting

### "Model is None"
- Check you're using the correct version number (currently 2)
- Verify the version is trained and deployed in Roboflow
- Run `python test_roboflow.py` to diagnose

### "No detection found"
- Try lowering `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` to 30
- Increase `DPI_FOR_DETECTION` to 150
- Check if the PDF layout is significantly different from training data

### "Address not found"
- Verify job code matches exactly in Google Sheet (case-insensitive)
- Check Google Sheet is shared with service account
- Run `python address_lookup.py` to test connection

### "Permission denied" (Google Sheets)
- Ensure you shared the sheet with the service account email
- Check `google_credentials.json` is in the correct location
- Verify sheet name matches `GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME` in config
